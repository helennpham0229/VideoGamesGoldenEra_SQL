# Video_Games_Golden_Era_SQL

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

In this project, we'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. We'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and we'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
